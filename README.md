# RATs

Some DIY PoC 
[RATs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_desktop_software#Malicious_variants)
to teach myself a little about them.

All take the form of simple command line REPL and assume some sort of
compromised HTTP endpoint for that C2.

For education purposes only.

No really, please don't use this for anything other than educating yourself.
